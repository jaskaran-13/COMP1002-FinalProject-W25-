            <h2>Our Design Philosophy</h2>
            <blockquote>
                "Lateral Thinking with Withered Technology" - Gunpei Yokoi
            </blockquote>
            <p>This approach of using mature, reliable technology in innovative ways led to the Game Boy's success. While competitors focused on color displays that drained batteries, the Game Boy's monochrome screen provided long play sessions and affordability.</p>
